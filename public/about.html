<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Balavignesh, a passionate full stack developer currently exploring the world of web development. 
  I specialize in building interactive and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks 
  like React and Node.js.</p>

<p>I love learning by building — whether it's a portfolio website, a todo app, or a backend API. Right now, 
  I’m focused on mastering the MERN stack and improving my problem-solving skills.</p>

<p>I’m actively looking for opportunities to collaborate, learn, and grow in the tech space. 
  When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring tech YouTube channels or binge-watching anime.</p>
